===========================================================

For this assignment you will be partnered with someone doing the other half of
the assignment. You MUST NOT share source code!!! What your source code does
must be a mystery to the other person. Each of you will make an archive
holding your half of the code, and the other person will link it against their
code to make a final executable.

Person A will work entirely in C++, and will make a couple arrays, fill them
with secret and interesting data, and then build team.cc into an archive
(static library) file and pass it to Person B using GitHub.

Person B will download Person A's library using GitHub and will link it
against their assembly code. Their assembly code must modify the arrays in
interesting AND SECRET (don't tell them) ways. They will compile their half
into an archive (static library) as well, and upload their half on GitHub as
well. Person B can build helper functions to print out ints if they want.

Person A will download Person B's archive, and link it against their code, and
write a short essay on Canvas about what their partner did to their beautiful
array, and say what data they passed to Person B.

Person B will write a short essay saying what they did to Person A's
array, and guess what Person A's array was originally.

GitHub summary:
1) Step one - go to GitHub.com, create an account if you don't have one.
Create a new repository called anything (but not code_tennis!!), add a license
(GPL probably) and a Readme.md with which you should mention this is a
homework assignment and for everyone to pay it no attention. (And you should
delete it after the assignment is done.)

2) Click on the green button to get the http link for your repository (which
we call a "Repo"). Send it to your partner over Discord or whatever.

3) Go into PuTTY and type "git clone <the URL>"

4) cd into the directory just made, and work on your assignment there. Or work
on it in code_tennis and then copy over the .a files later into here.

5) When your code is ready, make an archive of your .o file via "ar rcs
teama.a teama.o" (or teamb if you are person B)

6) Type "git add teama.a" to indicate it is ready to be uploaded to GitHub

7) Type "git commit" to stage all changes for transfer (these can be combined
if needed, but w/e). Type in a description of the change you made if you want

8) Type "git push" and this will upload it to GitHub. You will need to enter
your credentials.

THE OTHER PARTNER NOW

1) git clone <the URL your partner sent>

2) copy the .a file into your homework directory

3) link it against your code

4) ??

5) Profit
